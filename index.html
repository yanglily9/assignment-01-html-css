        Liang Qichao was an intellectual leader in the early 20th century. He was a Chinese philosopher, writer, poet,
        educator, and politician. He was born in the late Qing period and he passed the Chinese imperial examination at the
        age of 17. After he earned an imperial degree, he started to publish his works. He and his teachers initiated
        the
        Hundred Days reforms. He advocated for overthrowing the imperial examination. The late 19th century to early 20th century was the period when the last dynasty of China (Qing Dynasty) was about to end. He promoted for Western literature
        education system. He wrote various works to suggest scholars to eradicate traditional Chinese and replace it
        with
        vernacular Chinese. Vernacular Chinese is the simplified version of traditional Chinese: vernacular Chinese
        contains
        new vocabularies. He believed that vernacular Chinese and Western literature could aid Chinese scholars to find
        identities. However, after the failed reform attempt, Liang and his teachers fled to Japan. Despite the failure
        of the reform, there was tremendous literature (translation of western novels) produced during that period of
        time.
